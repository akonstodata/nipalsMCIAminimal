# nipalsMCIA: Software to Compute Multi-Block Dimensionality Reduction

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

This package computes Multiple Co-Inertia Analysis (MCIA) on multi-block data
using the Nonlinear Iterative Partial Least Squares (NIPALS) method.  
It is a minimal version of the `nipalsMCIA` package developed for general purpose
application of `nipalsMCIA` to a range of datasets.

Features include:  

* Efficient computation of deflation and variance enabling embedding of
  high-volume (e.g. single-cell) datasets.  
* Functionality to perform out-of-sample embedding.
* Easy-to-adjust options for deflation and pre-processing
* Multiple visualization and analysis options for sample- and feature-level
  embedding results
* Streamlined and well-documented and supported code that is consistent with
  published theory to enable more efficient algorithm development and extension
  
Major differences with the original `nipalsMCIA` implementation, in `nipalsMCIAminimal`:

* The input is a list of tables in subject x feature format,
in the original package, the input is required to be an MAE object.
* The output is a list, whereas the output is a class
in the original package.
* There are no tutorials for use of the package for biological applications.  
Please use the original package if you are interested applying the algorithm
to multi-omics data.

## Installation

This package currently can only be installed using `devtools::install_github()`.
A Bioconductor version is in progress. 

You can install the development version of nipalsMCIA from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r installation, echo = TRUE, results = 'hide', message = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Muunraker/nipalsMCIAminimal", ref = "master",
                         force = TRUE, build_vignettes = FALSE)
```

## Basic Example

The package currently includes one test dataset: `data_blocks`. This is a list
of dataframes containing  observations of variables from three omics types
(mRNA, proteins, and micro RNA)  on 21 cancer cell lines from the NCI60 cancer
cell lines. The data file includes a `metadata` data frame containing the cancer
type associated with each cell line. 

```{r}
# load the package and set a seed for reproducibility
library(nipalsMCIAminimal)
set.seed(42)
```

```{r load-data}
data(NCI60) # import data as "data_blocks" and metadata as "metadata_NCI60"

# examine the data and metadata
summary(data_blocks)
head(metadata_NCI60)
table(metadata_NCI60)
```

*Note: this dataset is reproduced from the [omicade4 package](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/omicade4.html)
(Meng et. al., 2014). This package assumes all input datasets are in sample by
feature format.*

The main MCIA function can be called on `data_blocks` and optionally can include
`metadata_NCI60` for plot coloring by cancer type:

```{r call-mcia, fig.dim = c(8, 4), fig.align = 'center', message = FALSE}
mcia_results <- nipals_multiblock(data_blocks, col_preproc_method = 'colprofile',
                                  metadata = metadata_NCI60,
                                  color_col = "cancerType", 
                                  num_PCs = 10, tol = 1e-12)
```

Here `numPCs` is the dimension of the low-dimensional embedding of the data chosen by the user.
